    "**Important points to note while inferencing**:\n",
    "1. As `predict_with_generate` can't be used, we will write the eval loop with `torch.cuda.amp.autocast()` as shown below.\n",
    "2. As the base model is frozen, PEFT model sometimes fails ot recognise the language while decoding.Hence, we force the starting tokens to mention the language we are transcribing. This is done via `forced_decoder_ids = processor.get_decoder_prompt_ids(language=\"Marathi\", task=\"transcribe\")` and passing that to the `model.generate` call.\n",
    "3. Please note that [AutoEvaluate Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/autoevaluate/leaderboards?dataset=mozilla-foundation%2Fcommon_voice_11_0&only_verified=0&task=automatic-speech-recognition&config=mr&split=test&metric=wer) for `mr` language on `common_voice_11_0` has a bug wherein openai's `BasicTextNormalizer` normalizer is used while evaluation leading to degerated output text, an example is shown below:\n",

    "```\n",
    "Post fixing this bug, we report the 2 metrics for the top model of the leaderboard and the PEFT model:\n",
    "1. `wer`: `wer` without using the `BasicTextNormalizer` as it doesn't cater to most indic languages. This is want we consider as true performance metric.\n",
    "2. `normalized_wer`: `wer` using the `BasicTextNormalizer` to be comparable to the leaderboard metrics.\n",
